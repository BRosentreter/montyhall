This is a fully functioning Monty Hall simulator that will produce the total number of wins and subsequently the win probability based on whether the user switches doors when prompted or does not.

To run the program, compile the Monty.C file using the given makefile and then run it with the command line arguents for the total number of runs and whether or not the strategy will be to switch doors, where 1 indicates that the user will be switching doors and a 0 indicates the user will not be switching doors. An example is given below which will run the simulation 10000 times while switching doors.
